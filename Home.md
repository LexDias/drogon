# Useful tips
* Completely read these instructions before cutting. Make sure you understood all instructions steps

* Avoid over application of glue! This may cause paper to wrinkle. Use a paint brush to apply glue on parts
* In some parts, you'll notice some white areas and yellow lines showing how pieces should line up when glued
* When you cut paper, white edges will be apparent. Use a marker or pencil to color these edges, before gluing them
* Mountain fold means printed surface should be on the outside
* Valley fold means printed surface should be on the inside
* When building, be sure the glue dries completely before proceeding to the next step
* When joining opened parts, like partial cones and cylinders, start gluing two tabs. When completely dry, glue remaining tabs
